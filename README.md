## Introduction

This template is designed to streamline the creation of Python projects by leveraging the [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/) project. Copier is a powerful tool for generating project scaffolding, allowing you to create consistent and customizable project structures with ease. By using this template, you can quickly set up a new Python project with predefined configurations and best practices, saving time and ensuring a solid foundation for your development work.
